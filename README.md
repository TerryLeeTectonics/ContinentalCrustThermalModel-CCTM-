# ContinentalLithopshereThermalModel
This repository contains a Python-based Continental Lithosphere Thermal Model. This model simulates the best-fit 1D steady-state conductive thermal profiles locally and integrates into a 3D model. This model also includes components of deriving the seismogenic thickness, and numerically solved 2D heat diffusion model.
